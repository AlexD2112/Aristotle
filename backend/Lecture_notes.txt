Fall of the Roman Empire — Lecture Notes

Overview
- "Fall of the Roman Empire" commonly refers to the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE; the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire continued until 1453.
- The collapse was gradual and multifactorial rather than a single catastrophic event.

Key dates and events
- 284 CE: Diocletian becomes emperor and introduces major administrative and military reforms.
- 330 CE: Constantine establishes Constantinople as a new imperial capital.
- 376–382 CE: Gothic migration and conflict following the Huns' westward pressure.
- 410 CE: Sack of Rome by the Visigoth king Alaric.
- 451 CE: Battle of the Catalaunian Plains against Attila the Hun.
- 476 CE: Deposition of Romulus Augustulus by Odoacer — conventional end of the Western Roman Empire.

Major internal causes
- Political instability: frequent changes of emperors, civil wars, and weakened central authority.
- Administrative complexity: the empire became harder to govern as it expanded; reliance on regional power-brokers.
- Economic troubles: heavy taxation, inflation, declining tax base, and trade disruptions.
- Social change: loss of civic identity, widening gap between elite and poor, dependence on slave labor that hindered technological and economic adaptation.
- Military problems: recruitment difficulties, reliance on federate (barbarian) troops, declining discipline and loyalty.

External pressures
- Barbarian migrations and invasions: Goths, Vandals, Franks, Burgundians, Lombards and others moved into Roman territories.
- Hunnic pressure: Huns displaced tribes, creating migration waves that stressed Roman frontiers.
- Loss of frontier control: weakened border defenses and abandonment of remote provinces.

Institutional and cultural factors
- Division of empire: administrative split (East/West) created diverging interests and resources.
- Role of Christianity: Church grew as a unifying and stabilizing institution, but also redirected resources and redefined loyalties; debates exist about its net effect.
- Urban decline and ruralization: cities shrank; power shifted to landholding elites and local strongmen.

Consequences
- Political fragmentation: emergence of Germanic kingdoms on former Western Roman territory.
- Long-term transformations: shift toward feudal structures, changes in land ownership, and new cultural synthesis (Roman, Germanic, Christian).
- Continuity in the East: Byzantine Empire preserved Roman law, administration, and urban life for centuries.
- Legacy: Roman law, infrastructure, language (Latin), and Christianity shaped medieval Europe.

Interpretive notes
- Historiography has moved from monocausal explanations to complex, interconnected models.
- Emphasis today is on incremental change, resilience of institutions, and regional variation rather than a single "fall."

Suggested topics for deeper study
- Diocletianic and Constantinian reforms
- The Gothic Wars and the sack of Rome
- Economic evidence: coinage, tax records, and trade routes
- Comparative study: Western collapse vs Eastern survival
